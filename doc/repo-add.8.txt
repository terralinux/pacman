Name
----
repo-add - package database maintenance utility

Synopsis
--------
repo-add [-d] [-f] [-q] <path-to-db> <package1> [<package2> ...]

repo-remove [-q] <path-to-db> <packagename> [<packagename2> ...]


Description
-----------
repo-add and repo-remove are two scripts to help build a package database for
packages built with linkman:makepkg[8] and installed with linkman:pacman[8].

repo-add will update a package database by reading a built package file.
Multiple packages to add can be specified on the command line.

repo-remove will update a package database by removing the package name
specified on the command line. Multiple packages to remove can be specified
on the command line.


Options
-------
*-d, \--delta*::
	Automatically generate and add a delta file between the old entry and the
	new one, if the old package file is found next to the new one.

*-f, \--files*::
	Tells repo-add also to create and include a list of the files in the
	specified packages. This is useful for creating databases listing all files
	in a given sync repository for tools that may use this information.

*-q, \--quiet*::
	Force this program to keep quiet and run silent except for warning and
	error messages.

*-s, \--sign*::
	Generate a PGP signature file using GnuPG. This will execute `gpg
	--detach-sign --use-agent` on the generated database to generate a detached
	signature file, using the GPG agent if it is available. The signature file
	will be the entire filename of the database with a ``.sig'' extension.
