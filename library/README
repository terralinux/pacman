This folder contains code snippets that can be reused by multiple
scripts.  A brief description of each file follows.

output_format.sh:
Provides basic output formatting functions with levels 'msg', 'msg2',
'warning' and 'error'.  The 'msg' amd 'msg2' functions print to stdout
and can be silenced by defining 'QUIET'.  The 'warning' and 'error'
functions print to stderr with the appropriate prefix added to the
message.

parse_options.sh:
A getopt replacement to avoids portability issues, in particular the
lack of long option name support in the default getopt provided by some
platforms.
Usage: parse_option $SHORT_OPTS $LONG_OPTS "$@"
